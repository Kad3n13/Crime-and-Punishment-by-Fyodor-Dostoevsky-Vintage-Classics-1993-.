<h1>Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky, 
<h2>(Vintage Classics, 1993).</h2>
<h3>translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky</h3>

> “Poverty is no vice.”
>
> “I know that drunkenness is also no virtue, and this is even more so. But destitution, my dear sir, destitution is a vice, sir. In poverty you may still preserve the nobility of your inborn feeling, but in destitution no one ever does. For destitution one does not even get driven out of human company with a stick; one is swept out with a broom, to make it more insulting—and justly so, for in destitution I am the first to insult myself. Hence the drinking!”
